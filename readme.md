# Turtorial
In this turtorial I will show you how to reverse engineer a game(growtopia)


## Why?
In the game you can't open a multiple instances of the game, which is really annoying
when you want to play with multiple account on the same device(who wants to buy a new device
just to play on multiple account? lol)
